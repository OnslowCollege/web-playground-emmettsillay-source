  <h2>Glass Cups</h2>

  <p style="font-size: 6px;"> This cup is incredibly useful, and sustainable for the environment, as you can use the glass over and over again for decades, and it'll be completely fine.<br>l Doing so will cause you no ill will, provided that you wash it, to avoid ingesting diseases and other viruses and germs that one wouldn't want to ingest.<br> This is opposed to something like a plastic cup, which you can only use once, and then it falls apart in your hands.<br> The only thing that the glass cup isn't immune to is being dropped, and that can easily be avoided by a simple phenomenon known as 'not being clumsy',<br> so it's plain to see that when you wish to drink from cups, use a glass cup, not a plastic cup.<br> i fired my writer after ts 😭😭😭⬆️⬆️⬆️</p>
